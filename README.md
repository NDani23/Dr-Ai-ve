# Dr(Ai)ve

**A simple racing game where you can compete against an agent that was trained using reinforcement learning :red_car:**

This project was made with [Unity ML-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) and it was my first experiment with RL. *The applicaton is mostly a showcase of the agent's skills wrapped in a simple single player game.*

The player can race against a ghost car controlled by the agent in 5 different tracks, while also monitor the current and best laptimes for both the AI and him/herself.

## Notes
Since this is a relatively small experimental project, i didn't made an installer for it, but anyone can build and run the application through the Unity Editor (Make sure to load the "Dr(ai)ve" sceen).

If you're interested about how the agent works and how i trained it, you can find a detailed explanation in the [hungarian documentation](documentation/doc_hun.pdf).
